<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-5">Unreal Engine</a></h2>
<p>Another contender is the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine">Unreal Engine</a>, a C++ game engine developed by Epic Games; we have not used it yet.</p>
<p>The Unreal Engine 5 brings new features that may be of interest, including a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/lumen-global-illumination-and-reflections-in-unreal-engine/">fully dynamic global illumination and reflection system</a> (Lumen, not requiring baked lightmaps anymore), a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/nanite-virtualized-geometry-in-unreal-engine/">virtualized geometry system</a> (Nanite, simplifying detailed geometries on the fly) and a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/features/quixel-megascans">quality 2D/3D asset library</a> (the Quixel Megascans library, obtained from real-world scans).</p>
<p>Unreal does not offer a scripting language anymore, user developments have to be done <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/unreal-engine-programming-and-scripting/">in C++</a> (beyond <em>Blueprints Visual Scripting</em>).</p>
<p>Its <a class="reference external" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/faq">licence</a> is meant to induce costs only when making large-enough profits; more precisely, a <em>5% royalty is due only if you are distributing an off-the-shelf product that incorporates Unreal Engine code (such as a game) and the lifetime gross revenue from that product exceeds $1 million USD</em> (the first $1 million remaining royalty-exempt); in case of large success, it may be a costlier licence than Unity.</p>
<p>With an Unreal user account, the sources of the engine (in its latest stable version, 5) <a class="reference external" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue-on-github">can be examined on Github</a> (so it is open source, yet not free software).</p>
<p>See its <a class="reference external" href="https://www.unrealengine.com">official website</a> and its <a class="reference external" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/store">marketplace</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="assets">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-6">Assets</a></h3>
<p>Purchased assets may be used in one's own shipped products (<a class="reference external" href="https://marketplacehelp.epicgames.com/s/article/How-can-I-use-the-products-I-ve-purchased-from-the-Marketplace-or-Learn-Tab?language=en_US">source</a>) and apparently at least usually no restrictive terms apply.</p>
<p>Assets not created by Epic Games can be used in other engines unless otherwise specified (<a class="reference external" href="https://marketplacehelp.epicgames.com/s/article/Can-I-use-these-products-in-other-gaming-engines-like-Source-or-Unity?language=en_US">source</a>).</p>

<div class="section" id="unity3d">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-7">Unity3D</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)">Unity</a> is most probably the cross-platform game engine that is the most popular.</p>
<p>Regarding the licensing of the engine, <a class="reference external" href="https://store.unity.com/#plans-individual">various plans</a> apply, depending notably on whether one subscribes as an individual or a team, and on one's profile, revenue and funding; the general idea is not taking royalties, but <strong>flat</strong>, per seat yearly fees increasing with the organisation &quot;size&quot; (typically in the $400-$1800 range, per seat).</p>
<p>See its <a class="reference external" href="https://unity.com/">official website</a> and its <a class="reference external" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/">asset store</a>.</p>
<p id="unity-assets">Unity may be installed at least in order to access its asset store, knowing that apparently an asset purchased in this store may be used with any game engine of choice. Indeed, for the standard licence, it is stipulated in the <a class="reference external" href="https://unity3d.com/legal/as_terms">EULA legal terms</a> that:</p>
<p><em>Licensor grants to the END-USER a non-exclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to the Asset to integrate Assets only as incorporated and embedded components of electronic games and interactive media and distribute such electronic game and interactive media.</em></p>
<p>So, in legal terms, an asset could be bought in the Unity Asset Store and used in Godot, for example - provided that its content can be used there technically without too much effort/constraints (this may happen with prefabs, specific animations, materials or shaders, conventions in use, etc.).</p>
<div class="section" id="installation-1">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-8">Installation</a></h3>
<p>Unity shall now be obtained thanks to the Unity Hub.</p>
<p>On Arch Linux it is <a class="reference external" href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/unityhub/">available through the AUR</a>, as an <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppImage">AppImage</a>; one may thus use: <tt class="docutils literal">yay <span class="pre">-Sy</span> unityhub</tt>.</p>
<p>Then, when running (as a non-priviledged user) <tt class="docutils literal">unityhub</tt>, a Unity account will be needed, then a licence, then a Unity release will have to be added in order to have it downloaded and installed for good, covering the selected target platforms (ex: Linux and Windows &quot;Build Supports&quot;).</p>
<p>We rely here on the Unity version 2021.2.7f1.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-9">Configuration</a></h3>
<p>Configuring Unity so that its interface (mouse, keyboard bindings) behave like, for example, the one of Blender, is not natively supported.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-11">Troubleshooting</a></h3>
<p>The log files are stored in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.config/unity3d</span></tt>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Unity Editor: <tt class="docutils literal">Editor.log</tt> (the most interesting one)</li>
<li>Unity Package Manager: <tt class="docutils literal">upm.log</tt></li>
<li>Unity Licensing client: <tt class="docutils literal">Unity.Licensing.Client.log</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>If the editor is stuck (ex: when importing an asset), one may use as a last resort <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Hull/blob/master/kill-unity3d.sh">kill-unity3d.sh</a>.</p>
<p>In term of persistent state, beyond the project trees themselves, there are:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<p>(nothing in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.cache</span></tt> apparently)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unity-assets-1">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-12">Unity Assets</a></h3>
<p>Once ordered through the Unity Asset Store, assets can be downloaded through the <tt class="docutils literal">Window <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> Package Manager</tt> menu, by replacing, in the top <tt class="docutils literal">Packages</tt> drop-down, the <tt class="docutils literal">In Project</tt> entry by the <tt class="docutils literal">My Assets</tt> one. After having selected an asset, use the <tt class="docutils literal">Download</tt> button at the bottom-right of the screen.</p>
<p>Then, to gain access to such downloaded assets, of course the simplest approach is to use the Unity editor; this is done by creating a project (ex: <tt class="docutils literal">MyProject</tt>), selecting the aforementioned menu option (just above), then clicking on <tt class="docutils literal">Import</tt> and selecting the relevant content that will end up in clear form in your project, i.e. in the UNIX filesystem with their actual name and content, for example in <tt class="docutils literal">MyProject/Assets/CorrespondingAssetProvider/AssetName</tt>. We experienced reproducible freezes when importing resources.</p>
<p>Yet such Unity packages, once downloaded (whether or not they have been imported in projects afterwards) are files stored typically in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.local/share/unity3d/Asset</span> <span class="pre">Store-5.x</span></tt> directory and whose extension is <tt class="docutils literal">.unitypackage</tt>.</p>
<p>Such files are actually <tt class="docutils literal">.tar.gz</tt> archives, and thus their content can be listed thanks to:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
$ tar tvzf Foobar.unitypackage
</pre>
<p>Inside such archives, each individual package resource is located in a directory whose name is probably akin to the checksum of this resource (ex: <tt class="docutils literal">167e85f3d750117459ff6199b79166fd</tt>) <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>; such directory generally contains at least 3 files:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">asset</tt>: the resource itself, renamed to that unique checksum name, yet containing its exact original content (ex: the one of a Targa image)</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">asset.meta</tt>: the metadata about that asset (file format, identifier, timestamp, type-specific settings, etc.), as an ASCII, YAML-like, text</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">pathname</tt>: the path of that asset in the package &quot;virtual&quot; tree (ex: <tt class="docutils literal">Assets/Foo/Textures/baz.tga</tt>)</li>
</ul>
<p>When applicable, a <tt class="docutils literal">preview.png</tt> file may also exist.</p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="footnote-1" rules="none">

<p>Some types of content are Unity-specific and thus may not transpose (at least directly) to another game engine. This is the case for example for materials or prefabs (whose file format is relatively simple, based on <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> 1.1).</p>
<p>Tools like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio">AssetStudio</a> (probably Windows-only) strive to automate most of the process of exploring, extracting and exporting Unity assets.</p>
<p>Meshes are typically in the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBX">FBX</a> (proprietary) file format, that can nevertheless be imported in <a class="reference internal" href="#blender">Blender</a> and converted to other file formats (ex: gltF 2.0); see <a class="reference internal" href="#blender-import">blender import</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#blender-convert">blender convert</a> for that.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-15">glTF</a></h3>
<p>We prefer to rely on the open, well-specified, modern <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF">glTF 2.0 format</a> in order to perform import/export operations.</p>
<p>It comes in two forms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>either as <tt class="docutils literal">*.gltf</tt> when JSON-based, possibly embedding the actual data (vertices, normals, textures, etc.) as ASCII <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64-encoded</a> content, or referencing external files</li>
<li>or as <tt class="docutils literal">*.glb</tt> when binary; this is the most compact form, and the one that we recommend especially</li>
</ul>
<p>See also the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/files/gltf20-reference-guide.pdf">glTF 2.0 quick reference guide</a>, the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/assets/importing_scenes.html">related section of Godot</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Sample-Viewer-Release/">this standard viewer of predefined glTF samples</a>.</p>
<p>This (generic) <a class="reference external" href="https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/">online glTF viewer</a> proved lightweight and convenient notably because it displays errors, warnings and information regarding the glTF data that it decodes.</p>

<div class="section" id="collada">

<p>Refer to <a class="reference internal" href="#blender-import">blender import</a> in order to handle the most common 3D file formats, and the next section about conversions.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">file</tt> command is able to report the version of at least some formats; for example:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
<span class="c1"># Means FBX 7.3:
</span>$ file foobar.fbx
foobar.fbx: Kaydara FBX model, version <span class="m">7300</span>
</pre>
<p>Too often, some tool will not be able to load a file and will fail to properly report why. When suspecting that a binary file (ex: a FBX one) references external content either missing or in an unsupported format (ex: PSD or TIFF?), one may peek at their content without any dedicated tool, directly from a terminal, like in:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
$ strings my_asset.fbx <span class="p">|</span> sort <span class="p">|</span> uniq <span class="p">|</span> grep <span class="s1">'\.'</span>

<p>This should list, among other elements, the paths that such a binary file is embedding.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-20">Recommended Option: Relying on Blender</a></h3>
<p>Using <a class="reference internal" href="#blender-import">blender import</a> is the primary solution that we see: a content, once imported in Blender, can be saved in any of the supported formats.</p>
<p>Yet this operation may fail, for example on &quot;older&quot; FBX files, whose FBX version (ex: 6.1) is not supported by Blender (&quot;<em>Version 6100 unsupported, must be 7100 or later</em>&quot;) or by other tools such as Godot.

<span id="autodesk-converter"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-21">Workaround #1: Using Autodesk FBX Converter</a></h3>
<p>The simpler approach seems to download the (free) <a class="reference external" href="https://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/fbx20133_converter_win_x64.exe">Autodesk FBX Converter</a> and to use <a class="reference external" href="GNULinux.html#wine">wine</a> to run it on GNU/Linux. Just install then this converter with: <tt class="docutils literal">wine fbx20133_converter_win_x64.exe</tt>.</p>
<p>A convenient alias (based on default settings, typically to be put in one's <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.bashrc</span></tt>) can then be defined to run it:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
$ <span class="nb">alias</span> fbx-converter-ui<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span><span class="s2">/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Autodesk/FBX/FBX\ Converter/2013.3/FBXConverterUI.exe 2&gt;/dev/null &amp;&quot;</span>
</pre>
<p>Conversions may take place from, for example, FBX 6.1 (also: 3DS, DAE, DXF, OBJ) to a FBX version in: 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 (i.e. 7.3 - of course the most interesting one here), but also DXF, OBJ and Collada, with various settings (embedded media, binary/ASCII mode, etc.).</p>
<p>An even better option is to use directly the command-line tool <tt class="docutils literal">bin/FbxConverter.exe</tt>, which the previous user interface actually executes. Use its <tt class="docutils literal">/?</tt> option to get help, with interesting information.</p>
<p>For example, to update a file in a presumably older FBX into a 7.3 one (that Blender can import):</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
$ <span class="nb">cd</span> ~/.wine/drive_c/Program<span class="se">\ </span>Files/Autodesk/FBX/FBX<span class="se">\ </span>Converter/2013.3/bin
$ FbxConverter.exe My-legacy.FBX newer.fbx /v /sffFBX /dffFBX /e /f201300
</pre>
<p>We devised the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Hull/blob/master/update-fbx.sh">update-fbx.sh</a> script to automate such an in-place FBX update.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at least on one FBX sample taken from a Unity package, if the mesh could be imported in Blender, textures and materials were not (having checked <tt class="docutils literal">Embed media</tt> in the converter or not).</p>

<div class="section" id="workaround-2-relying-on-unity">

<p>Unity does not allow to export for example FBX natively, however a package for that is provided. It shall be installed first, once per project.</p>
<p>One shall select in the menu <tt class="docutils literal">Window <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> Package Manager</tt>, ensure that the entry <tt class="docutils literal">Packages:</tt> points to <tt class="docutils literal">Unity Registry</tt>, and search for <tt class="docutils literal">FBX Exporter</tt>, then install it (bottom right button).</p>

<div class="section" id="asset-providers">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-24">Asset Providers</a></h2>
<p>Usually, for one's creation, much multimedia artwork has to be secured: typically graphical assets (ex: 2D/3D geometries, animations, textures) and/or audio ones (ex: music, sounds, speech syntheses, special effects).</p>
<p>Instead of creating such content by oneself (not enough time/interest/skill?), it may be more relevant to rely on specialised third-parties.</p>
<p><strong>Hiring a professional or a freelance</strong> is then an option. This is of course relatively expensive, involves more efforts (to define requirements and review the results), longer, but it is to provide exactly the artwork that one would like.</p>
<p>Another option is to rely on specialised third-party providers that <strong>sell non-exclusive licences for the content they offer</strong>.</p>
<p>These providers can be either direct <strong>content producers</strong> (companies with staffs of modellers), or <strong>asset aggregators</strong> (marketplaces which federate the offers of many producers of any size) that are often created in link to a given multimedia engine. An interesting point is that assets purchased in these stores generally can be used in any technical context, hence are not meant to be bound to the corresponding engine.</p>
<p>Nowadays, much content is available, in terms of theme/setting (ex: Medieval, Science-Fiction, etc.), of nature (ex: characters, environments, vehicles, etc.), etc. and the overall quality/price ratio is rather good.</p>
<p>The main advantages of these marketplaces is that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>they favor the competition between content providers: the clients can easily compare assets and share their opinion about them</li>
<li>they generalised simple, standard, unobtrusive licensing terms; ex: royalty free, allowing content to be used as they are or in a modified form, not limited by types of usage, number of distributed copies, duration of use, number of countries addressed, etc.; the general rule is that much freedom is left to the asset purchasers provided that they use for their own projects (rather than for example selling the artwork as they are)</li>

<p>These translate easily for instance in the vanilla C GL/GLU implementations. As an example, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/gl.html#ortho-6">gl:ortho/6</a> (<tt class="docutils literal">6</tt> designating here the arity of that function, i.e. the number of the arguments that it takes) corresponds to its C counterpart, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl2.1/xhtml/glOrtho.xml">glOrtho</a>.</p>
<p>The reference pages for OpenGL (in version 4.x) can be <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/">browsed here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that initially the information here related to older versions of OpenGL (1.1, 2.1, etc.; see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/History_of_OpenGL">history</a>) that relied on a fixed pipeline (no shader support) - whereas, starting from OpenGL 3.0, many of the corresponding features were marked as deprecated, and actually removed in 3.1. However, thanks to the <em>compatibility context</em> (whose support is not mandatory - but that all major implementations of OpenGL provide), these features can still be used.</p>
<p>Yet nowadays relying on at least OpenGL 3 <em>core</em> context (not using the compatibility context) would be preferable (source: <a class="reference external" href="https://erlangforums.com/t/no-gl-get-1/1035">this thread</a>). Still better options would be to rely on OpenGL 4 Core or OpenGL ES 2+, or libraries on top of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan">Vulkan</a>, like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu">wgpu</a>.

<p>As of 2022, the current OpenGL version is 4.6; we will try to stick to the latest ones (4.x) only (ex: skipping intermediate changes in 3.2); even though in this document reminiscences of older OpenGL versions remain, the current minimum that we target is the <strong>Core Profile of OpenGL 3.3</strong>, which is &quot;modern OpenGL&quot; and introduced most features that still apply (and will halt on error if any deprecated functionality is used).</p>
<p>For more general-purpose computations (as opposed to rendering operations) to be offset to a GPU/GPGU, one may rely on <a class="reference external" href="Erlang.html#opencl">OpenCL</a> instead.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-34">Basics</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>OpenGL is a <strong>software interface to graphics hardware</strong>, i.e. the <em>specification</em> of an API (of around 150 functions in its older version 1.1), developed and maintained by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/">Khronos Group</a></li>
<li>a video card will run an <em>implementation</em> of that specification, generally developed by the manufacturer of that card; a good rule of thumb is to always update one's video card drivers to its <strong>latest stable version</strong>, as OpenGL implementations are constantly improved (bug-fixing) and updated (with regard to newer OpenGL versions)</li>
<li>OpenGL concentrates on <strong>hardware-independent 2D/3D rendering</strong>; no commands for performing window-related tasks or obtaining user input are included; for example frame buffer configuration is done outside of OpenGL, in conjunction with the windowing system</li>
<li>OpenGL offers only <strong>low-level primitives</strong> organised through a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.glprogramming.com/blue/ch02.html#id57691">pipeline</a> in which vertices are assembled into primitives, then to fragments, and finally to pixels in the frame buffer; as such, OpenGL is a building-block for higher-level engines (ex: like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)">Godot</a>)</li>
<li>OpenGL is a <strong>procedural</strong> (function-based, not object-oriented) <strong>state machine</strong> comprising a larger number of variables defined within a given OpenGL state (named <em>OpenGL context</em>; comprising vertex coordinates, textures, frame buffer, etc.); said otherwise, relatively to an OpenGL context (which is often implicit), all OpenGL state variables behave like global variables; when a parameter is set, it applies and lasts as long as it is not modified; the effect of an OpenGL command may vary depending on whether certain modes are enabled (i.e. whether some state variables are set)</li>
<li>so the <strong>currently processed element</strong> (ex: a vertex) <strong>inherits (implicitly) the current settings of the context</strong> (ex: color, normal, texture coordinate, etc.); this is the only reasonable mode of operation, knowing that a host of parameters apply when performing a rendering operation (specifying all these parameters would not be a realistic option); as a result, any specific parameter shall be set first (prior to triggering such an operation), and is to last afterwards (being &quot;implicitly inherited&quot;), until possibly being reassigned in some later point in time</li>
<li>OpenGL respects a <strong>client/server execution model</strong>: an application (a specific client, running on a CPU) issues commands to a rendering server (on the same host or not - see GLX; generally the server can be seen as running on a local graphic card), that executes them <strong>sequentially and in-order</strong>; as such, most of the calls performed by user programs are <strong>asynchronous</strong>: they are triggered by the program through OpenGL, and return almost immediately, whereas they have not been executed yet; they have just be queued; indeed OpenGL implementations are almost always pipelined, so the rendering must be thought as primarily taking place in a background process; additional facilities like <em>Display Lists</em> allow to pipeline operations (as opposed to the default <em>immediate mode</em>), which are accumulated for processing at a later time, as fast as the graphic card can process them</li>
<li>state variables are mostly server-side, yet some of them are client-side; in both cases, they can be gathered in <em>attribute groups</em>, which can be pushed on, and popped from, their respective server or client attribute stacks</li>
<li>OpenGL manages two types of data, handled by mostly different paths of its rendering pipeline, yet that are ultimately integrated in the framebuffer through fragment-yielding rasterization:<ul>
<li>geometric data (vertices, lines, and polygons)</li>
<li>pixel data (pixels, images, and bitmaps)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>vertices and normals are transformed by the <strong>model-view</strong> and <strong>projection</strong> matrices (that can be each set and transformed on a stack of their own), before being used to produce an image in the frame buffer; texture coordinates are transformed by the <strong>texture</strong> matrix</li>
<li>textures may reside in the main, general-purpose, client, <strong>CPU-side memory</strong> (large and slow to access for the rendering) and/or in any auxiliary, dedicated, server-side <strong>GPU memory</strong> (more constrained, hence prioritized thanks to <em>texture objects</em>; and, rendering-wise, of significantly higher-performance)</li>
<li>OpenGL has to apply any kind of transformation, linear (ex: rotation, scaling) or not (ex: translation, perspective) to geometries, for example in order to perform referential changes or rendering; each of these transformations can be represented as a 4x4 <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates">homogeneous matrix</a>, with floating-point (homogeneous) coordinates <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-reference-3">[3]</a>; a series of transformations can then simply be represented as a single of such matrices, corresponding to the product of the involved transformation matrices</li>

<li>whereas, with the conventions discussed, OpenGL will expect it to be stored in-memory in this order: <tt class="docutils literal">a11, a21, <span class="pre">...,</span> am1, a21, a22, <span class="pre">...,</span> am2, <span class="pre">...,</span> a1n, a2n, <span class="pre">...,</span> amn</tt>, i.e. as the transpose of the previous matrix</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>these <a class="reference external" href="http://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/math/matrix/column-vec.html">OpenGL storage conventions</a> do not tell how matrices are to be multiplied (knowing of course that the matrix product is not commutative); if following the aforementioned OpenGL <em>documentation</em> conventions, one should consider that OpenGL relies on the usual multiplication order, that is <strong>post-multiplication</strong>, i.e. <em>multiplication on the right</em>; this means that, if applying on a given matrix <span class="math">\(M\)</span> a transformation <span class="math">\(O\)</span> (ex: rotation, translation, scaling, etc.) represented by a matrix <span class="math">\(M_O\)</span>, the resulting matrix will be <span class="math">\(M' = M.M_O\)</span> (and not <span class="math">\(M' = M_O.M\)</span>); a series of operations <span class="math">\(O_1\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(O_2\)</span>, ..., then <span class="math">\(O_n\)</span> will therefore correspond to a matrix <span class="math">\(M' = M_{O1}.M_{O2}.[...].M_{On}\)</span>; applying a vector <span class="math">\(\vec{V}\)</span> to a  matrix <span class="math">\(M\)</span> will result in <span class="math">\(\vec{V'} = M.\vec{V}\)</span></li>
<li>so when an OpenGL program performs calls like first for a rotation (r), then for a scaling (s) and finally for a translation (t):</li>

</pre>
<p>the current matrix <span class="math">\(M\)</span> ends up being multiplied (on the right) by <span class="math">\(M' = M_r.M_s.M_t\)</span>; when applied to a vector <span class="math">\(\vec{V}\)</span>, still multiplying on the right results in <span class="math">\(\vec{V'} = M.\vec{V} = M.M_r.M_s.M_t.\vec{V}'\)</span>; so the input vector <span class="math">\(\vec{V}\)</span> is first translated, then the result is scaled, then rotated, then transformed by the previous matrix <span class="math">\(M\)</span>; as a result: <strong>operations happen in the opposite order of their specification as calls</strong>; said differently: one shall specify the calls corresponding to one's target series of transformations <em>backwards</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>considering that the OpenGL storage is done in a surprising column-major order was actually a trick so that OpenGL could rely on the (modern, math-originating) vector-as-column convention while being still compliant with its GL ancestor - which relied on the (now unusual) vector-as-row convention and on <em>pre-multiplication</em> (where we would have <span class="math">\(M' = M_O.M\)</span>); indeed, knowing that, when transposing matrices, <span class="math">\((A.B)^\top = B^\top.A^\top\)</span>, one may consider that OpenGL actually always operates on transpose elements, and thus that: (1) matrices are actually specified in row-order and (2) they are multiplied on the left (ex: <span class="math">\(M' = M_t.M_s.M_r.M\)</span>); note that switching convention does not affect at all the computations, and that the same operations are always performed in reverse call order</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">OpenGL can operate on three mutually exclusive <strong>modes</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>rendering</em>: the default, most common one, discussed here</li>
<li><em>feedback</em>: allows to capture the primitives generated by the vertex processing, i.e. to establish the primitives that would be displayed after the transformation and clipping steps; often used in order to resubmit this data multiple times</li>
<li><em>selection</em>: determines which primitives would be drawn into some region of a window (like in <em>feedback</em> mode), yet based on stacks of only user-specified &quot;names&quot; (so that the actual data of the corresponding primitives is not returned, just their name identifier); a special case of selection is <em>picking</em>, allowing to determine what are the primitives rendered at a given point of the viewport (typically the onscreen position of the mouse cursor, to enable corresponding interactions)</li>

<div class="section" id="steps-for-opengl-rendering">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-35">Steps for OpenGL Rendering</a></h3>
<p>The usual analogy to describe them is the process of <strong>producing a photography</strong>:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>a set of elements (3D objects) can be placed (in terms of position and orientation) as wanted in order to compose one's scene of interest (<em>modelling transformations</em>, with world coordinates)</li>
<li>the photographer may similarly place as wanted his camera (<em>viewing transformations</em>, with camera coordinates)</li>
<li>the settings of the camera can be adjusted, for example regarding its lens / zoom factor (<em>projection transformations</em>, with window coordinates)</li>
<li>the snapshots that it takes can be further adapted before being printed, for example in terms of scaling (<em>viewport transformations</em>, with screen coordinates)</li>
</ol>
<p>One can see that the first two steps are reciprocal; for example, moving all objects in a direction or moving the camera in the opposite direction is basically the same operation. These two operations, being the two sides of the same coin, can thus be managed by a single matrix, the <em>model-view</em> one.</p>
<p>Finally, as mentioned in the section about storage conventions, in OpenGL, operations are to be defined in reverse order. If naming <span class="math">\(M_s\)</span> the matrix implementing a given step S, the previous process would be implemented by an overall matrix, based on the previous bullet numbers: <span class="math">\(M = M_4.M_3.M_2.M_1\)</span>, so that applying a vector <span class="math">\(\vec{V}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(M\)</span> results in <span class="math">\(\vec{V'} = M.\vec{V} = M_4.M_3.M_2.M_1.\vec{V} = M_4.(M_3.(M_2.(M_1.\vec{V})))\)</span>.</p>

<p>In this context, except notably the projections, most are invertible, and a composition of invertible transformations, in any combination and sequence, is itself invertible.</p>
<p>As mentioned, they can all be expressed as 4x4 homogeneous matrices, and their composition translates into the (orderly) product of their matrices.</p>

<h4>Translations / Rotations / Scalings / Shearings</h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the inverse of a <strong>translation</strong> of a vector <span class="math">\(\vec{T}\)</span> is a translation of vector <span class="math">\(\vec{-T}\)</span>, thus: <span class="math">\((Mt_\vec{T})^{-1} = Mt_{-\vec{T}}\)</span></li>
<li>the inverse of a <strong>rotation</strong> of an angle <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> along a vector <span class="math">\(\vec{U}\)</span> is a rotation of an angle <span class="math">\(-\theta\)</span> along the same vector, thus: <span class="math">\((Mr_(\vec{u},\theta))^{-1} = Mr_(\vec{u},-\theta)\)</span></li>
<li>the inverse of a <strong>scaling</strong> of a (non-null) factor <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a scaling of factor <span class="math">\(1/f\)</span>, thus: <span class="math">\((Ms_f)^{-1} = Ms_{1/f}\)</span>; the same applies for each factor when performing a shear mapping</li>

<h4>Affine Transformations</h4>
<p>An <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation">affine transformation</a> designates all geometric transformations that preserve lines and parallelism (but not necessarily distances and angles).</p>

<div class="section" id="projections">
<h4>Projections</h4>
<p>A projection defines 6 clipping planes (and at least 6 additional ones can be defined).</p>
<p>A 3D plane is defined by including a given (3D) point and comprising all vectors orthogonal to a given vector; it can be defined thanks to 4 coordinates (ex: <tt class="docutils literal">(a, b, c, d)</tt>); and a point <span class="math">\(P = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}\)</span> will belong to such a plane iff <span class="math">\(a.x + b.y + c.z + d = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Two kinds of projections are considered: orthographic and perspective.</p>
<div class="section" id="orthographic-projections">
<h5>Orthographic Projections</h5>
<p>Their viewing volume is a parallelepiped, precisely a rectangular cuboid.</p>
<p>With such projections, parallel lines remain parallel; see <tt class="docutils literal">gl:ortho/6</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">glu:ortho2D/4</tt>.</p>

<div class="section" id="perspective-projections">
<h5>Perspective Projections</h5>
<p>Their viewing volume is a truncated pyramid.</p>

<div class="section" id="viewport-transformations">
<h5>Viewport Transformations</h5>
<p>As for the viewport, it is generally defined with <tt class="docutils literal">gl:viewport/4</tt> so that its size corresponds to the widget in which the rendering is to take place.</p>
<p>To avoid distortion, its aspect ratio must be the same as the one of the projection transformation.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="section" id="camera">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-37">Camera</a></h3>
<p>The default model-view matrix is an identity; the camera (or eye) is located at the origin, points down the negative Z-axis, and has an up-vector of <tt class="docutils literal">(0, 1, 0)</tt>.</p>
<p>With Z-up conventions (like in Myriad ones), this corresponds to a camera pointing downward.</p>
<p>Calling <tt class="docutils literal">glu:lookAt/9</tt> allows to set arbitrarily one's camera position and orientation.</p>
<p>In order to switch from (OpenGL) Y-up conventions to Z-up ones, another option is to rotate the initial (identity) model-view matrix along the X axis of an angle of <span class="math">\(-\pi/2\)</span>, or to (post-)multiply the model-view matrix with:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
M_{camera} = P_{zup{\rightarrow}yup} = \begin{bmatrix}
       1 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
       0 &amp;  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
       0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
       0 &amp;   0 &amp;   0 &amp;  1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>For example, if we want that this camera sees, in (Z-up) MyriadGUI referential, a point <tt class="docutils literal">P</tt> at coordinates <span class="math">\(P_{zup}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\)</span> (thus a point in its Y axis), its coordinates in the base OpenGL (Y-up) referential must be <span class="math">\(P_{yup} = P_{zup{\rightarrow}yup}.P_{zup} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\)</span> ; refer to the <a class="reference internal" href="#computing-transition-matrices">Computing Transition Matrices</a> section for more information.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-38">Hints</a></h3>
<ul class="simple" id="gl-bindings">
<li>a frequent pattern is, for some type of OpenGL element (let's name it <tt class="docutils literal">Foo</tt>; it could designate for example <tt class="docutils literal">Texture</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Buffer</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">VertexArray</tt>) is: first <tt class="docutils literal">glGenObjects(1, &amp;fooId);</tt> (note the plural) is used, then <tt class="docutils literal">glBindObject(GL_SOME_TARGET, fooId);</tt><ul>
<li>it must be understood that <tt class="docutils literal">glGenObjects</tt> is the actual creator of (at least) one new (blank) instance of <tt class="docutils literal">Foo</tt>, whose address is kept by OpenGL behind the scenes; the user program will be able to access this instance only once bound thanks to an additional level of indirection, its (GL) identifier (<tt class="docutils literal">fooId</tt> here)</li>
<li>as for <tt class="docutils literal">glBindObject</tt>, its role is to register the <tt class="docutils literal">Foo</tt> pointer corresponding to the specified identifier <tt class="docutils literal">fooId</tt> in the C-like struct that corresponds to the current context (i.e. the current state of OpenGL), in the field designated here by <tt class="docutils literal">GL_SOME_TARGET</tt>, like in: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">current_gl_context-&gt;gl_some_target</span> = foo_pointer_for(fooId)</tt>; this operation is thus mostly an assignment</li>
<li>once bound, this <tt class="docutils literal">Foo</tt> instance can be accessed implicitly (through the current context) by calls such as <tt class="docutils literal">glSetFooOption(GL_SOME_TARGET, GL_OPTION_FOO_WIDTH, 800);</tt> (where neither its identifier nor any pointer for it is specified); once done, this instance can be unbound with <tt class="docutils literal">glBindObject(GL_SOME_TARGET, 0);</tt>; rebinding that identifier later will restore the corresponding options; as a result, several instances can be created, corresponding to as many sets of predefined options, and when a given one shall apply, it just has to be bound</li>

<p>A popular convention, for example detailed in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter02.html#name10">this section</a> of the Red book, is to consider that the ordinates increase when going from the <em>bottom of the viewport to its top</em>; then for example the on-screen lower-left corner of the OpenGL canvas is <tt class="docutils literal">(0,0)</tt>, and its upper-right corner is <tt class="docutils literal">(Width,Height)</tt>.</p>
<p>As for us, we prefer the <a class="reference external" href="https://myriad.esperide.org/#2d-referential">MyriadGUI 2D conventions</a>, in which ordinates increase when going from the <em>top of the viewport to its bottom</em>, as depicted in the following figure:</p>
<p><span class="raw-html"><center><img src="myriad-2D-referential.png" id="responsive-image-xsmall"></img></center></span>
</p>
<p>Such a setting can be obtained thanks to (with Erlang conventions):</p>

<p>In this case, the viewport can be addressed like a <strong>usual (2D) framebuffer</strong> (like provided by any classical 2D backend such as SDL) obeying the coordinate system just described: if the width of the OpenGL canvas is 800 pixels and its height is 600 pixels, then its top-left on-screen corner is <tt class="docutils literal">(0,0)</tt> and its bottom-right one is <tt class="docutils literal">(799,599)</tt>, and any pixel-level operation can be directly performed there &quot;as usual&quot;. One may refer, in Myriad, to <tt class="docutils literal">gui_opengl_2D_test.erl</tt> for a full example thereof, in which line-based letters are drawn to demonstrate these conventions.</p>
<p>Each time the OpenGL canvas is resized, this projection matrix will have to be updated, with the same procedure, yet based on the new dimensions.</p>
<p>Another option - still with axes respecting the Myriad 2D conventions - is to operate this time based on <strong>normalised, definition-independent coordinates</strong>, ranging in <tt class="docutils literal">[0.0, 1.0]</tt>, like in:</p>

</pre>
<p>Using &quot;stable&quot;, device-independent floats instead of integers directly accounting for pixels may be more convenient. For example a resizing of the viewport will then not require an update of the projection matrix. One may refer to <tt class="docutils literal">gui_opengl_minimal_test.erl</tt> for a full example thereof.</p>

<div class="section" id="referentials-in-3d">
<span id="d-referentials"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-42">Referentials In 3D</a></h3>
<p>We will rely here as well on the Myriad conventions, <a class="reference external" href="https://myriad.esperide.org/#3d-referential">this time for 3D</a> (not taking specifically time into account here):</p>
<p><span class="raw-html"><center><img src="myriad-space-time-referential.png" id="responsive-image-tiny"></img></center></span>
</p>
<p>These are thus Z-up conventions (the Z axis being vertical and designating altitudes), like modelling software such as Blender.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-tree-of-referentials">
<h4>A Tree of Referentials</h4>
<p>In the general case, either in 2D or (more often of interest here) in 3D, a given scene (a model) is made of a set of elements (ex: the model of a street may comprise a car, two bikes, a few people) that will have to be rendered from a given viewpoint (ex: a window on the second floor of a given building) onto the (flat) user screen (with suitable clipping, perspective division and projection on the viewport). Let's start from the intended result and unwind the process.</p>
<p>The rendering objective requires to have ultimately one's scene transformed as a whole in eyes coordinates (to obtain coordinates along the aforementioned 2D screen referential, along the X and Y axes - the Z one serving to sort out depth, as per our conventions).</p>
<p>For that, a prerequisite is to have the target scene correctly composed, with all its elements defined in the same (scene-global) space, in their respective position and orientation (then only the viewpoint, i.e. the virtual camera, can take into account the scene as a whole, to transform it to eye coordinates).</p>
<p>As each individual type of model (ex: a bike model) is natively defined in an abstract, local referential (an orthonormal basis) of its own, each actual model instance (ex: the first bike, the second bike) has to be specifically placed in the referential of the overall scene. This placement is either directly defined in that target space (ex: bike A is at this absolute position and orientation in the scene global referential) or relatively to a <em>series</em> of parent referentials (ex: this character rides bike B - and thus is defined relatively to it, knowing that the bike is placed relatively to the car, and that the car itself is placed relatively to the scene).</p>
<p>So in the general case, referentials are nested (recursively defined relatively to their parent) and form a tree <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-reference-4">[4]</a> whose root corresponds to the (possibly absolute) referential of the overall scene, like in:</p>
<p><span class="raw-html"><center><img src="referential-tree.png" id="responsive-image-small"></img></center></span>
</p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="footnote-4" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#footnote-reference-4">[4]</a></td><td><p class="first">This is actually named a <em>scene graph</em> rather than a <em>scene tree</em>, as if we consider the leaves of that &quot;tree&quot; to contain actual geometries (ex: of an abstract bike), as soon as a given geometry is instantiated more than once (ex: if having 2 of such bikes in the scene), this geometry will have multiple parents and thus the corresponding scene will be a graph.</p>
<p class="last">As for us, we consider <em>referential trees</em> (no geometry involved) - a given 3D object being possibly associated to (1) a referential and (2) a geometry (independently).</p>
</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>A series of model transformations has thus to be operated in order to express all models in the scene referential:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(local referential of model Rh) -&gt; (parent referential Rf) -&gt; (parent referential Ra) -&gt; (scene referential Rs)
</pre>
<p>For example the hand of a character may be defined in <span class="math">\(R_h\)</span>, itself defined relatively to its associated forearm in <span class="math">\(R_f\)</span> up to the overall referential <span class="math">\(R_a\)</span> of that character, defined relatively to the referential of the whole scene, <span class="math">\(R_s\)</span>. This referential may have no explicit parent defined, meaning implicitly that it is defined in the canonical, global referential.</p>
<p>Once the <strong>model</strong> is expressed as a whole in the scene-global referential, the next transformations have to be conducted : <strong>view</strong> and projection. The view transformation involves at least an extra referential, the one of the camera in charge of the rendering, which is <span class="math">\(R_c\)</span>, possibly defined relatively to <span class="math">\(R_s\)</span>.</p>
<p>So a geometry (ex: a part of the hand, defined in <span class="math">\(R_f\)</span>) has been transformed upward in the referential tree in order to be expressed in the common, &quot;global&quot; scene referential <span class="math">\(R_s\)</span>, before being transformed last in the camera one, <span class="math">\(R_c\)</span>.</p>
<p>In practice, all these operations can be done thanks to the multiplication of homogeneous 4x4 matrices, each able to express any combination of rotations, scalings/reflections/shearings, translations, which thus include the transformation of one referential into another. Their product can be computed once, and then applying a vector (ex: corresponding to a vertex) to the resulting matrix allows to perform in one go the full composition thereof, encoding all model-view transformations and even the projection as well.</p>
<p>Noting <span class="math">\(P_{a{\rightarrow}b}\)</span> the transition matrix transforming a vector <span class="math">\(\vec{V_a}\)</span> expressed in <span class="math">\(R_a\)</span> into its representation <span class="math">\(\vec{V_b}\)</span> in <span class="math">\(R_b\)</span>, we have:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\vec{V_b} = P_{a{\rightarrow}b}.\vec{V_a}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Thus, to express the geometry of said hand (natively defined in <span class="math">\(R_h\)</span>) in camera space (hence in <span class="math">\(R_c\)</span>), the following composition of referential changes <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-reference-5">[5]</a> shall be applied:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
P_{h{\rightarrow}c} = P_{s{\rightarrow}c}.P_{a{\rightarrow}s}.P_{f{\rightarrow}a}.P_{h{\rightarrow}f}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="footnote-5" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#footnote-reference-5">[5]</a></td><td>Thus transformation matrices, knowing that the product of such matrices is in turn a transformation matrix.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So a whole series of transformations can be done by applying a single matrix - whose coordinates are determined now.</p>

</ul>
<p>The objective is to determine <span class="math">\(P_{2\rightarrow1}\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math">\(R\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\vec{T}\)</span>.</p>
<p>By definition of a transition matrix, for any point <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, we have: <span class="math">\(P_1 = P_{2\rightarrow1}.P_2 \qquad (1)\)</span></p>
<p>Let's study <span class="math">\(P_{2\rightarrow1}\)</span> by first choosing a point <span class="math">\(P\)</span> equal to the origin of <span class="math">\(R_2\)</span> (shown as <tt class="docutils literal">Ob</tt> in the figure).</p>
<p>By design, in homogeneous coordinates, <span class="math">\(P_2 = Ob_2 = \begin{Bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{Bmatrix}\)</span> and applying it on <span class="math">\((1)\)</span> gives us: <span class="math">\(P_1 = Ob_1 = \begin{Bmatrix} t1 \\ t2 \\ t3 \\ 1 \end{Bmatrix}\)</span>.</p>
<p>So if <span class="math">\(Ob_1 = \begin{Bmatrix} XOb_1 \\ YOb_1 \\ ZOb_1 \\ 1 \end{Bmatrix}\)</span>, we have: <span class="math">\(\vec{T} = \vec{T_{2\rightarrow1}} = \begin{bmatrix} XOb_1 \\ YOb_1 \\ ZOb_1 \end{bmatrix}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let's now determine the <span class="math">\(r_{xy}\)</span> coordinates.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(R_{2\rightarrow1}\)</span> be the (3x3) rotation matrix transforming any vector expressed in <span class="math">\(R_2\)</span> in its representation in <span class="math">\(R_1\)</span>: for any (3D) vector <span class="math">\(\vec{V}\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\(\vec{V_1} = R_{2\rightarrow1}.\vec{V_2}  \qquad (2)\)</span></p>
<p>(we are dealing with vectors, not points, hence the origins are not involved here).</p>
<p>By choosing <span class="math">\(\vec{V}\)</span> equal to the <span class="math">\(\vec{Ib}\)</span> (abscissa) axis of <span class="math">\(R_2\)</span> (shown as <tt class="docutils literal">Ib</tt> in the figure), we have <span class="math">\(\vec{Ib_1} = R_{2\rightarrow1}.\vec{Ib_2}\)</span></p>
<p>Knowing that by design <span class="math">\(\vec{Ib_2} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\)</span>, <span class="math">\((2)\)</span> gives us:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\vec{Ib_1} = \begin{bmatrix} r_{11} \\ r_{21} \\ r_{31} \end{bmatrix}
          = \begin{bmatrix} XIb_{1} \\ YIb_{1} \\ ZIb_{1} \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So the first column of the <span class="math">\(R\)</span> matrix is <span class="math">\(\vec{Ib_1}\)</span> , i.e. the first axis of <span class="math">\(R_2\)</span> as expressed in <span class="math">\(R_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using in the same way the two other axes of <span class="math">\(R_2\)</span> (shown as <tt class="docutils literal">Jb</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Kb</tt> in the figure), we see that:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
R = R_{2\rightarrow1}

</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
  = \begin{bmatrix}

       ZIb_{1} &amp; ZJb_{1} &amp; ZKb_{1} \\

<p>So the transition matrix from <span class="math">\(R_2\)</span> to <span class="math">\(R_1\)</span> is:</p>

<p>Often, transformations have to be used both ways, like in the case of a scene-to-camera transformation; as a consequence, transition matrices may have to be inversed, knowing that <span class="math">\((P_{2\rightarrow1})^{-1} = P_{1\rightarrow2}\)</span> (since by definition <span class="math">\(P_{2\rightarrow1}.P_{1\rightarrow2} = Id\)</span>).</p>
<p>An option to determine <span class="math">\(P_{1\rightarrow2}\)</span> from <span class="math">\(P_{2\rightarrow1}\)</span> could be to compute its inverse directly, as <span class="math">\(P_{1\rightarrow2} = (P_{2\rightarrow1})^{-1}\)</span>, yet <span class="math">\(P_{1\rightarrow2}\)</span> may be determined in a simpler manner.</p>
<p>Indeed, for a given point <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, whose representation is <span class="math">\(P_1\)</span> in <span class="math">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(P_2\)</span> in <span class="math">\(R_2\)</span>, we obtain <span class="math">\(P_1 =  P_{2\rightarrow1}.P_2\)</span> by - through the way (4x4) matrices are multiplied - first applying a (3x3) rotation <span class="math">\(Rot_3\)</span> to <span class="math">\(P_2\)</span> and then a (3D) translation <span class="math">\(T_r\)</span>: <span class="math">\(P_1 = Rot_3.P_2 + T_r\)</span> (in 3D; thus leaving out any fourth homogeneous coordinate); therefore <span class="math">\(P_2 = (Rot_3)^{-1}.(P_1 - T_r)\)</span>. Knowing that the inverse of an orthogonal matrix is its transpose, and that rotation matrices are orthogonal, <span class="math">\((Rot_3)^{-1} = (Rot_3)^\top\)</span>, and thus <span class="math">\(P_2 = (Rot_3)^\top.(P_1 - T_r) = (Rot_3)^\top.P_1 - (Rot_3)^\top.T_r)\)</span>. So if:</p>

<p>As a result, from the definition of a tree of referentials, we are able to compute the transition matrix transforming the representation of a vector expressed in any of them to its representation in any of the other referentials.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-44">Main Matrices</a></h2>
<p>These matrices account for the main processing steps of a rendering.</p>
<p>Three types of referentials can be considered:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>world</strong> referential: the absolute, overall referential where 3D scenes are to be assembled</li>
<li><strong>local</strong> referential: a referential in which a given model is defined (generally located at its origin)</li>
<li><strong>camera</strong> referential: a referential where a camera is at the origin, looking down on the negative Z axis</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>clip space</strong> can also be considered; this is the post-projection space, where the view frustum is transformed into a cube, centered in the origin, and going from -1 to 1 in every axis.</p>
<p>The transformations between referentials can be represented by 4×4 transition matrices:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>model matrix</strong> (<span class="math">\(M_M\)</span>): to transform from local to world referential</li>
<li><strong>view matrix</strong> (<span class="math">\(M_V\)</span>): to transform from world to camera referential</li>
<li><strong>projection matrix</strong> (<span class="math">\(M_P\)</span>): to transform from camera referential to clip space</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, two composite matrices are especially useful (note the aforementioned reverse multiplication order) and are typically passed through uniform variables in shaders:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ModelView: <span class="math">\(M_{MV} = M_V.M_M\)</span></li>
<li>ModelViewProj: <span class="math">\(M_{MVP} = M_P.M_{MV} =  M_P.M_V.M_M\)</span></li>

<p>Shaders are the basic rendering building blocks of applications using modern OpenGL (ex: 3.x/4.0).</p>
<p>Such an application will indeed program its own shaders, instead of calling functions like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">glBegin()/glEnd()</span></tt>, as it was done with OpenGL 1.x-2.x and its fixed-pipeline immediate mode.</p>

<p>The key is to write programs that can be executed in a <em>Single Instruction, Multiple Data</em> (SIMD) setting, in order to take advantage of the vectorization typically supported by GPUs.</p>
<p>A goal is to avoid conditional branching based on values that may differ from a shader invocation to another (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Shader#Execution_model_and_divergence">this explanation</a>).</p>
<p>If having to take into account two dynamically-uniform (i.e. non-statically predictable, yet having the same value for very shader invocation within that group) branches performing simple computations, it is likely that the compiler will generate code evaluating both expressions, until dropping the result of the one finally not happening.</p>

<p>They are portions of C-like code that can be inserted in the rendering pipeline implemented by the OpenGL driver of a GPU card.

</div>
<div class="section" id="implementing-a-shader">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-50">Implementing a Shader</a></h3>
<p>A shader is quite similar to a C program, yet based on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_(GLSL)">a specific, core language</a> that enables the definition of relevant data types and functions.</p>
<p>Data types are usually based on elementary types (<tt class="docutils literal">float</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">double</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">bool</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">int</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">uint</tt>), and composed in larger structures, like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">{vec,mat}{2,3,4}</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">mat2x3</tt>, arrays and structures, possibly <tt class="docutils literal">const</tt>; see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/glsl-tutorial/data-types/">this page</a> for further details.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/glsl-tutorial/statements-and-functions/">control flow statements and (non-recursive) functions</a> can be used; every shader must have a <tt class="docutils literal">main</tt> function, and can define other auxiliary functions as well, in a way similar to a C program. Function parameters may have the <tt class="docutils literal">in</tt> (which is the default), <tt class="docutils literal">out</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">inout</tt> qualifiers specified. Additionally a function may return a result, thanks to <tt class="docutils literal">return</tt>.</p>
<p>So, regarding output, for example a fragment shader must return the color that it computed; <tt class="docutils literal">out vec3 my_color;</tt> declares this; and the shader code may be as simple as returning a constant color in all cases, like in:</p>
<pre class="code glsl literal-block">
<span class="cp">#version 330 core</span><span class="w">

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-51">Communicating with Shaders</a></h3>
<p>Of course the application must have a way of supplying information to its shaders (the other way round does not really happen, except for compute shaders), and a given shader must be able to pass information to (only) any next shader in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Two options exist for shaders to have inputs and outputs, from/to the CPU and/or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/glsl-tutorial/inter-shader-communication/">other shaders</a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<p>These communication options are discussed more in-depth next.</p>
<div class="section" id="vertex-attributes">
<h4>Vertex Attributes</h4>
<div class="section" id="defining-attributes">
<h5>Defining Attributes</h5>
<p>A vertex attribute, whether user-defined or built-in, may store any kind of data - notably positions, texture coordinates and normals.</p>
<p>Either a given attribute is a single, <em>standalone</em> one (then a unique value will be read and will apply to all vertices), or is <em>per-vertex</em>, in which case it is read from a buffer, each element of it being bound accordingly when its associated vertex is processed by the shader. Such arrays are either used in-order, or according to any indices defined (then themselves defined thanks to an array as well) <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-reference-10">[10]</a>.</p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="footnote-10" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#footnote-reference-10">[10]</a></td><td>This is the preferred method, as it prevents vertex duplication, and allows to process each of them once: there is a vertex cache that stores the outputs of the last processed vertices, so that if a vertex is mentioned multiple times (ex: being included in a triangle fan or strip), the corresponding output may be directly re-used (provided it is still in the cache) instead of having to be computed again.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Said differently, for each attribute used by a shader, either a single value or an array thereof must be specified.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="referencing-attributes">
<h5>Referencing Attributes</h5>
<p>In order that attributes can be referenced from at least one shader, they must be matched:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>by <em>name</em>: then they must bear exactly the same name in the main program and in the shaders using them, knowing that any name beginning with <tt class="docutils literal">gl_</tt> is reserved</li>
<li>or by <em>location</em>: their common location is specified, and a per-shader variable name is associated - which is more flexible</li>
<li>or by <em>block</em>, like for the uniform variables, discussed below</li>
</ul>
<p>In the two last cases, the layout of variables must match on either side (ex: main program/shader); for example, with &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">layout(location = 0) in vec3 input_vertex;</tt>&quot; in its code, a vertex shader will expect a (single) vector of 3 (floating-point) coordinates (<tt class="docutils literal">vec3</tt>) to be found at index 0 (<tt class="docutils literal">location = 0</tt>) as input (<tt class="docutils literal">in</tt>); the application will need to specify a corresponding <em>Vertex Buffer Object</em> (VBO) for that.</p>
<p>So that they can be fetched for a given vertex, attributes have to be appropriately located in buffers. For each attribute, either the developer defines, prior to linking, a specific location (as an index starting at zero) with <tt class="docutils literal">glBindAttribLocation</tt>, or he lets OpenGL choose it, and queries it afterwards, with <tt class="docutils literal">glGetAttribLocation</tt>; refer to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/glsl-tutorial/attribute-variables/">this page</a> for further details.</p>
<p>If a given program is linked with two shaders, a vertex one and a fragment one, the former one will probably have to pass its outputs as inputs of the latter one; this requires as many variables defined on either side, with relevant out/in specifications, and a matching name and type; for example the vertex shader may declare <tt class="docutils literal">out vec3 my_Color;</tt> whereas the fragment shader will declare <tt class="docutils literal">in vec3 my_Color;</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="providing-attribute-data-vao-and-vbo">
<h5>Providing Attribute Data : VAO and VBO</h5>
<p>Vertex data is provided thanks to a (single current) <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Specification#Vertex_Array_Object">Vertex Array Object</a> (VAO).</p>
<p>A VAO references (rather than storing directly) the format of the vertex data, as well as the buffers (VBOs, see below) holding that data.</p>
<p>A vertex attribute is identified by a number (in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[0;GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS-1]</span></tt>), and by default is accessed as a single value (as opposed to as an array).</p>
<p>A <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Specification#Vertex_Buffer_Object">Vertex Buffer Object</a> (VBO) is a data array, typically referenced by a VAO. A VBO defines its internal structure and where the corresponding data can be found.</p>
<p>So, in practice, each homogeneous chunk of data to be sent from the CPU-space to the GPU-space (vertices, normals, colors) is stored in an array corresponding to a <em>Vertex Buffer Object</em> (VBO), itself stored in a <em>Vertex Array Object</em> (VAO). A VAO may gather vertex data and colour data in separate VBOs, and store them on the graphics card for any later use (as opposed to streaming vertices through to the graphics card when they become needed). A VAO is only meant to hold one (VBO) array of vertices, each other VBO being used then for per-vertex attributes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uniform-variables-are-read-only-and-global">
<h4>Uniform Variables are Read-Only and Global</h4>
<p>Instead of relying on attributes, an alternate way of passing information, provided that it may change relatively infrequently, is to use <em>uniform variables</em>, which behave, for a shader and in the course of a draw call, as read-only, constant global variables for all vertices (hence their <em>uniform</em> naming). Any shader can access every uniform variable (they are globzl), as long as it declares that variable.</p>
<p>Examples of uniform variables could be the position of a light, transformation matrices, fog settings, variables such as gravity and speed, etc.</p>
<p>Uniform variables may be defined individually, or be grouped in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/glsl-tutorial/uniform-blocks/">named blocks</a>, for a more effective data setup (to share uniform variables between programs) and transfer from the application to the shader (setting multiple values at once).</p>
<p>Uniform variables are declared at the program-level (as opposed to a per-vertex level) thanks to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> qualifier on the shader-side, like in <tt class="docutils literal">uniform mat4 MyMatrix;</tt></li>
<li>a <tt class="docutils literal">glGetUniformLocation</tt> call on the application-side, to create a location associated to a name (ex: &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">MyMatrix</tt>&quot;), and to associate it to a given value, like in:</li>

<p>Individual variables may be used as uniform, as well as arrays and structs.</p>
<p>From the point of view of a shader, these named input variables may be initialised when declared, but then are read-only; otherwise the application may choose to set them.</p>

<div class="section" id="built-in-variables-are-defined-by-each-shader-type">
<h4>Built-in Variables are Defined by Each Shader Type</h4>
<p>Finally, depending on the type of a shader, some predefined, built-in variables (&quot;intrinsic attributes&quot;) may be set; they are <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Built-in_Variable_(GLSL)">specified here</a>.</p>
<p>For example, for a vertex shader, following output variables are predefined:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">vec4 gl_Position</tt> corresponding to the clip-space (homogeneous) position of the output vertex</li>

<p>See the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dgud/wings/tree/master/shaders">ones of Wings3D</a> (in GLSL &quot;1.2&quot; apparently, presumably for maximum backward compatibility; note that some elements, with the <tt class="docutils literal">*.cl</tt> extension, are OpenCL ones), or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/glsl-tutorial/geometry-shader-examples/">these ones</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="managing-spatial-transformations">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-53">Managing Spatial Transformations</a></h3>
<p>Modern OpenGL (and GLU) implementations basically dropped the direct matrix support (the so-called immediate mode does not exist anymore, except in a compatibility context). So no more calls to <tt class="docutils literal">glTranslate</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">glRotate</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">glLoadIdentity</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">gluPerspective</tt> shall be done; now the application has to compute such matrices (for model, view, texture, normal, projection, etc.) by itself (on the CPU), as inputs to its GLSL shaders.</p>
<p>For that, applications may use dedicated, separate libraries, such as, in C/C++, GLM, i.e. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/g-truc/glm">OpenGL Mathematics</a> (Myriad's <a class="reference external" href="http://myriad.esperide.org/#spatial-support">linear support</a> aims to provide, in Erlang, a relevant subset of these operations).</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLSL_Programming/Applying_Matrix_Transformations">matrices that correspond to the transformations</a> to be applied are then typically shared with the shaders thanks to uniform variables.</p>
<p>This is especially the case for the vertex shader, in charge of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLSL_Programming/Vertex_Transformations">transforming coordinates expressed in a local referential into screen coordinates</a>.</p>
<p>More precisely, the modeling (object-space to absolute, world-space), viewing (world-space to camera-space) and projection transformation (camera-space to clip-space) are applied in the vertex shader, whereas the final perspective division and the viewport transformation are applied in the fixed-function stage after the vertex shader.</p>
<p>So a vertex shader is usually given two 4x4 homogeneous, uniform matrices:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a modelview matrix, combining modeling and viewing, to transform object-space to camera-space in one go</li>
<li>a projection matrix</li>
</ul>

<p>Determining the shadow of an arbitrary object on an arbitrary plane (representing typically the ground - or other objects) from an arbitrary light source (possibly at infinity) corresponds to performing a specific <strong>projection</strong>. For that, a relevant 4x4 (based on homogeneous coordinates) matrix (singular, i.e. non-invertible matrix) can be defined.</p>
<p>This matrix can be multiplied with the top of the model-view matrix stack, before drawing the object of interest in the shadow color (a shade of black generally).</p>

<p>Benefiting from a proper 2D/3D hardware acceleration on GNU/Linux is unfortunately not always straightforward, and sometimes brittle.</p>
<p>The very first step is to <strong>update's one's video drivers to their latest, official stable version</strong> according to your OS/distribution of choice (even if it implies using closed-source binaries...) and check that they are in use (probably reboot then).</p>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-58">Testing</a></h2>
<p>First, one may check whether such acceleration is already available by running, from the command-line and as the current, non-priviledged user, the <tt class="docutils literal">glxinfo</tt> executable (to be obtained on Arch Linux thanks to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mesa-utils</span></tt> package), and hope to see, among the many displayed lines, <tt class="docutils literal">direct rendering: Yes</tt>.</p>
<p>One may also run our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Hull/blob/master/display-opengl-information.sh">display-opengl-information.sh</a> script to report relevant information.</p>
<p>A final validation might be to run the <tt class="docutils literal">glxgears</tt> executable (still obtained through the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mesa-utils</span></tt> package), and to ensure that a window appears, showing three gears properly rotating.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="troubleshooting-1">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-59">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
<p>If it is not the case (no direct rendering, or a GLX error being returned - typically involving any <tt class="docutils literal">X Error of failed request:&nbsp; BadValue</tt> for a <tt class="docutils literal">X_GLXCreateNewContext</tt>), one should investigate one's configuration (with <tt class="docutils literal">lspci | grep VGA</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">lsmod</tt>, etc.), update one's video driver on par with the current kernel, reboot, sacrifice a chicken, etc.</p>
<p>If using a NVidia graphic card, consider reading this <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA">Arch Linux wiki page</a> first.</p>
<p>In our case, installation could be done with <tt class="docutils literal">pacman <span class="pre">-Sy</span> nvidia <span class="pre">nvidia-utils</span></tt> but requested a reboot.</p>
<p>Despite package dependencies and a not-so-successful attempt of using DKMS in order to link kernel updates with graphic controller updates, too often a proper 3D support was lost, either from the boot or afterwards. Refer to our <a class="reference external" href="GNULinux.html#software-update">software update section</a> for hints in order to secure the durable use of proper drivers.</p>

<li><strong>IK</strong>: <em>Inverse Kinematics</em>, the <strong>computation of intermediary joint parameters</strong> so that the end of the kinematic chain is at a given position and orientation; typically, if one wants the hand of a character to grasp the top of a chair, IK is used in order to determine the parameters of the character's wrist, arm, elbow, etc. that may be retained so that the hand is ultimately correctly placed on the chair (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics">more information</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Material</strong>: controls the optical properties of an object, i.e. how a 3D object appears on the screen, that is: the color of each point of the object (generally thanks to multiple texture maps, like diffusion, normal, specular, glow, etc.) and how reflective or dull its surface appears; designates, with OpenGL, a set of coefficients that define <strong>how the lighting model interacts with the surface</strong>; in particular, ambient, diffuse, and specular coefficients for each color component (R,G,B) are defined and applied to a surface and effectively multiplied by the amount of light of each kind/color that strikes the surface; a final emmissivity coefficient is then added to each color component so that objects can also be light emitters</li>
<li><strong>NURBS</strong>: <em>Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline</em>, a mathematical model using <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline">basis splines</a> (B-splines) that is commonly used in computer graphics for representing <strong>curves and surfaces</strong>, whose shape is determined by control points (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline">more information</a>)</li>
<li><strong>PBR</strong>: <em>Physically-Based Rendering</em> designates approaches to render images in a way that <strong>models the flow of light in the real world</strong>, for example thanks to photogrammetry; many PBR pipelines aim to achieve photorealism; in practice they often rely on the <strong>micro-facet theory</strong>, with specific materials (generally based on texture maps) and shaders (is also called PBS, for <em>Physically-Based Shading</em>); PBR is slowly becoming the standard for all materials</li>
<li><strong>PSD</strong>: <em>Photoshop Document</em>, a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/psd/">proprietary format for graphics</a> with layers, masks, etc. used by Adobe Photoshop (a commercial counterpart to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://krita.org">Krita</a>, etc.) often used to store textures that may still be edited as templates by the user - provided they are using Photoshop as well; however, at least to some extent, <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.gimp.org/wiki/PSD_support">Gimp is able to edit PSD files</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.krita.org/en/general_concepts/file_formats/file_psd.html">Krita too</a></li>
<li><strong>Rigging</strong> (or <em>Skeletal Animation</em>) consists in <strong>controlling the deformation of a mesh</strong> (a.k.a. a <em>skin</em>, the surface of a body) of an articulated object (typically a character) <strong>based on a virtual inner armature</strong> (a hierarchical set of interconnected parts, called <em>bones</em>, and collectively forming the skeleton or <em>rig</em>) in order to animate that mesh (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation">more information</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Textures</strong>: bitmaps (images) used to <strong>skin 3D objects</strong>, by defining the color of each point on the surface of the object in terms of texture coordinates; besides such 2D textures, 1D, 3D and 4D ones exist</li>
<li><strong>Texture Atlas</strong>: a texture (an image) containing a <strong>set of separate, elementary graphic elements</strong>, meant to be extracted based on texture coordinates, akin to a sprite sheet; doing so is useful to reduce the overhead that would be induced by the management of many smaller textures (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas">more information</a>)</li>
