<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id29">Unity3D</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)">Unity</a> is most probably the cross-platform game engine that is the most popular.</p>
<p>Regarding the licensing of the engine, <a class="reference external" href="https://store.unity.com/#plans-individual">various plans</a> apply, depending notably on whether one subscribes as an individual or a team, and on one's profile, revenue and funding.</p>
<p>See its <a class="reference external" href="https://unity.com/">official website</a> and its <a class="reference external" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/">asset store</a>.</p>
<p id="unity-assets">Unity may be installed at least in order to access its asset store, knowing that apparently an asset purchased in this store may be used with any game engine of choice. Indeed, for the standard licence, it is stipulated in the <a class="reference external" href="https://unity3d.com/legal/as_terms">EULA legal terms</a> that:</p>
<p><em>Licensor grants to the END-USER a non-exclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to the Asset to integrate Assets only as incorporated and embedded components of electronic games and interactive media and distribute such electronic game and interactive media.</em></p>
<p>So, in legal terms, an asset could be bought in the Unity Asset Store and used in Godot, for example - provided that its content can be used there technically without too much effort/constraints (this may happen with prefabs, specific animations, materials or shaders, conventions in use, etc.).</p>
<div class="section" id="id7">
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Unity shall now be obtained thanks to the Unity Hub.</p>
<p>On Arch Linux it is <a class="reference external" href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/unityhub/">available through the AUR</a>, as an <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppImage">AppImage</a>; one may thus use: <tt class="docutils literal">yay <span class="pre">-Sy</span> unityhub</tt>.</p>
<p>Then, when running (as a non-priviledged user) <tt class="docutils literal">unityhub</tt>, a Unity account will be needed, then a licence, then a Unity release will have to be added in order to have it downloaded and installed for good, covering the selected target platforms (ex: Linux and Windows &quot;Build Supports&quot;).</p>
<p>We rely here on the Unity version 2021.2.7f1.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="troubleshooting">
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>The log files are stored in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.config/unity3d</span></tt>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Unity Editor: <tt class="docutils literal">Editor.log</tt> (the most interesting one)</li>
<li>Unity Package Manager: <tt class="docutils literal">upm.log</tt></li>
<li>Unity Licensing client: <tt class="docutils literal">Unity.Licensing.Client.log</tt></li>

</ul>
<p>(nothing in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.cache</span></tt> apparently)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id8">
<h3>Unity Assets</h3>
<p>Once ordered through the Unity Asset Store, assets can be downloaded through the <tt class="docutils literal">Window <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> Package Manager</tt> menu, by replacing, in the top <tt class="docutils literal">Packages</tt> drop-down, the <tt class="docutils literal">In Project</tt> entry by the <tt class="docutils literal">My Assets</tt> one. After having selected an asset, use the <tt class="docutils literal">Download</tt> button at the bottom-right of the screen.</p>
<p>Then, to gain access to such downloaded assets, of course the simplest approach is to use the Unity editor; this is done by creating a project (ex: <tt class="docutils literal">MyProject</tt>), selecting the aforementioned menu option (just above), then clicking on <tt class="docutils literal">Import</tt> and selecting the relevant content that will end up in clear form in your project, i.e. in the UNIX filesystem with their actual name and content, for example in <tt class="docutils literal">MyProject/Assets/CorrespondingAssetProvider/AssetName</tt>. We experienced reproducible freezes when importing resources.</p>
<p>Yet such Unity packages, once downloaded (whether or not they have been imported in projects afterwards) are files stored typically in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.local/share/unity3d/Asset</span> <span class="pre">Store-5.x</span></tt> directory and whose extension is <tt class="docutils literal">.unitypackage</tt>.</p>
<p>Such files are actually <tt class="docutils literal">.tar.gz</tt> archives, and thus their content can be listed thanks to:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
$ tar tvzf Foobar.unitypackage
</pre>
<p>Inside such archives, each individual package resource is located in a directory whose name is probably akin to the checksum of this resource (ex: <tt class="docutils literal">167e85f3d750117459ff6199b79166fd</tt>) <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id9">[1]</a>; such directory generally contains at least 3 files:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">asset</tt>: the resource itself, renamed to that unique checksum name, yet containing its exact original content (ex: the one of a Targa image)</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">asset.meta</tt>: the metadata about that asset (file format, identifier, timestamp, type-specific settings, etc.), as an ASCII, YAML-like, text</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">pathname</tt>: the path of that asset in the package &quot;virtual&quot; tree (ex: <tt class="docutils literal">Assets/Foo/Textures/baz.tga</tt>)</li>
</ul>
<p>When applicable, a <tt class="docutils literal">preview.png</tt> file may also exist.</p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id10" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">

<p>Some types of content are Unity-specific and thus may not transpose (at least directly) to another game engine. This is the case for example for materials or prefabs (whose file format is relatively simple, based on <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> 1.1).</p>
<p>Tools like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio">AssetStudio</a> (probably Windows-only) strive to automate most of the process of exploring, extracting and exporting Unity assets.</p>
<p>Meshes are typically in the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBX">FBX</a> (proprietary) file format, that can nevertheless be imported in <a class="reference internal" href="#blender">Blender</a> and converted to other file formats (ex: gltF 2.0); see <a class="reference internal" href="#blender-import">blender import</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#blender-convert">blender convert</a> for that.</p>

<div class="section" id="file-formats">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id31">File Formats</a></h2>
<p>They are designed to store 3D content (scenes, nodes, vertices, normals, meshes, textures, materials, animations, skins, cameras, lights, etc.).</p>
<p>We prefer to rely on the open, well-specified, modern <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF">glTF 2.0 format</a> in order to perform import/export operations.</p>
<p>It comes in two forms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>either as <tt class="docutils literal">*.gltf</tt> when JSON-based, possibly embedding the actual data (vertices, normals, textures, etc.) as ASCII <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64-encoded</a> content, or referencing external files</li>
<li>or as <tt class="docutils literal">*.glb</tt> when binary; this is the most compact form, and the one that we recommend especially</li>
</ul>
<p>See also the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/files/gltf20-reference-guide.pdf">glTF 2.0 quick reference guide</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/assets/importing_scenes.html">related section of Godot</a>.</p>
<p>The second best choice that we see is <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COLLADA">Collada</a> (<tt class="docutils literal">*.dae</tt> files), an XML-based counterpart (open as well, yet older and with less validating facilities) to glTF.</p>
<p>Often, assets can be found as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBX">FBX</a> of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file">OBJ</a> files and thus may have to be converted (typically to glTF), which is never a riskless task. FBX comes in two flavours: text-based (ASCII) or binary, see <a class="reference external" href="https://code.blender.org/2013/08/fbx-binary-file-format-specification/">this retro-specification</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Refer to <a class="reference internal" href="#blender-import">blender import</a> in order to handle the most common 3D file formats, and the next section about conversions.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">file</tt> command is able to report the version of at least some formats; for example:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
<span class="c1"># Means FBX 7.3:
</span>$ file foobar.fbx
foobar.fbx: Kaydara FBX model, version <span class="m">7300</span>
</pre>
<p>Too often, some tool will not be able to load a file and will fail to properly report why. When suspecting that a binary file (ex: a FBX one) references external content either missing or in an unsupported format (ex: PSD or TIFF?), one may peek at their content without any dedicated tool, directly from a terminal, like in:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
$ strings my_asset.fbx <span class="p">|</span> sort <span class="p">|</span> uniq <span class="p">|</span> grep <span class="s1">'\.'</span>
</pre>
<p>This should list, among other elements, the paths that such a binary file is embedding.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conversions">
<span id="format-conversions"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id32">Conversions</a></h2>
<p>Due to the larger number of 3D file formats and the role of commercial software, interoperability regarding 3D content is poor and depends on many versions (of tools and formats).</p>
<div class="section" id="recommended-option-relying-on-blender">
<h3>Recommended Option: Relying on Blender</h3>
<p>Using <a class="reference internal" href="#blender-import">blender import</a> is the primary solution that we see: a content, once imported in Blender, can be saved in any of the supported formats.</p>
<p>Yet this operation may fail, for example on &quot;older&quot; FBX files, whose FBX version (ex: 6.1) is not supported by Blender (&quot;<em>Version 6100 unsupported, must be 7100 or later</em>&quot;) or by other tools such as Godot. See also the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/files/media/index.html">Media Formats</a> supported by Blender.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workaround-1-using-autodesk-fbx-converter">
<span id="autodesk-converter"></span><h3>Workaround #1: Using Autodesk FBX Converter</h3>
<p>The simpler approach seems to download the (free) <a class="reference external" href="https://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/fbx20133_converter_win_x64.exe">Autodesk FBX Converter</a> and to use <a class="reference external" href="GNULinux.html#wine">wine</a> to run it on GNU/Linux. Just install then this converter with: <tt class="docutils literal">wine fbx20133_converter_win_x64.exe</tt>.</p>
<p>A convenient alias (based on default settings, typically to be put in one's <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.bashrc</span></tt>) can then be defined to run it:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
$ <span class="nb">alias</span> fbx-converter-ui<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span><span class="s2">/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Autodesk/FBX/FBX\ Converter/2013.3/FBXConverterUI.exe 2&gt;/dev/null &amp;&quot;</span>
</pre>
<p>Conversions may take place from, for example, FBX 6.1 (also: 3DS, DAE, DXF, OBJ) to a FBX version in: 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 (i.e. 7.3 - of course the most interesting one here), but also DXF, OBJ and Collada, with various settings (embedded media, binary/ASCII mode, etc.).</p>
<p>An even better option is to use directly the command-line tool <tt class="docutils literal">bin/FbxConverter.exe</tt>, which the previous user interface actually executes. Use its <tt class="docutils literal">/?</tt> option to get help, with interesting information.</p>
<p>For example, to update a file in a presumably older FBX into a 7.3 one (that Blender can import):</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
$ <span class="nb">cd</span> ~/.wine/drive_c/Program<span class="se">\ </span>Files/Autodesk/FBX/FBX<span class="se">\ </span>Converter/2013.3/bin
$ FbxConverter.exe My-legacy.FBX newer.fbx /v /sffFBX /dffFBX /e /f201300
</pre>
<p>We devised the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Hull/blob/master/update-fbx.sh">update-fbx.sh</a> script to automate such an in-place FBX update.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at least on one FBX sample taken from a Unity package, if the mesh could be imported in Blender, textures and materials were not (having checked <tt class="docutils literal">Embed media</tt> in the converter or not).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workaround-2-relying-on-unity">
<h3>Workaround #2: Relying on Unity</h3>
<p>Here the principle is to import a content in Unity (the same could probably be done with Godot), and to export it from there.</p>
<p>Unity does not allow to export for example FBX natively, however a package for that is provided. It shall be installed first, once per project.</p>
<p>One shall select in the menu <tt class="docutils literal">Window <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> Package Manager</tt>, ensure that the entry <tt class="docutils literal">Packages:</tt> points to <tt class="docutils literal">Unity Registry</tt>, and search for <tt class="docutils literal">FBX Exporter</tt>, then install it (bottom right button).</p>
<p>Afterwards, in the <tt class="docutils literal">GameObject</tt> menu, an <tt class="docutils literal">Export to FBX</tt> option will be available. Select the <tt class="docutils literal">Binary</tt> export format (not <tt class="docutils literal">ASCII</tt>) if wanting to be compliant with Blender.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id34">Asset Providers</a></h2>
<p>Usually, for one's creation, much multimedia artwork has to be secured: typically graphical assets (ex: 2D/3D geometries, animations, textures) and/or audio ones (ex: music, sounds, speech syntheses, special effects).</p>
<p>Instead of creating such content by oneself (not enough time/interest/skill?), it may be more relevant to rely on specialised third-parties.</p>
<p><strong>Hiring a professional or a freelance</strong> is then an option. This is of course relatively expensive, involves more efforts (to define requirements and review the results), longer, but it is to provide exactly the artwork that one would like.</p>
<p>Another option is to rely on specialised third-party providers that <strong>sell non-exclusive licences for the content they offer</strong>.</p>
<p>These providers can be either direct <strong>content producers</strong> (companies with staffs of modellers), or <strong>asset aggregators</strong> (marketplaces which federate the offers of many producers of any size) that are often created in link to a given multimedia engine. An interesting point is that assets purchased in these stores generally can be used in any technical context, hence are not meant to be bound to the corresponding engine.</p>
<p>Nowadays, much content is available, in terms of theme/setting (ex: Medieval, Science-Fiction, etc.), of nature (ex: characters, environments, vehicles, etc.), etc. and the overall quality/price ratio is rather good.</p>
<p>The main advantages of these marketplaces is that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>they favor the competition between content providers: the clients can easily compare assets and share their opinion about them</li>
<li>they generalised simple, standard, unobtrusive licensing terms; ex: royalty free, allowing content to be used as they are or in a modified form, not limited by types of usage, number of distributed copies, duration of use, number of countries addressed, etc.; the general rule is that much freedom is left to the asset purchasers provided that they use for their own projects (rather than for example selling the artwork as they are)</li>
</ul>
<p>The main content aggregators that we spotted are (roughly by decreasing order of interest, based on our limited experience):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the <a class="reference external" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/">Unity Asset Store</a>, already discussed in the <a class="reference internal" href="#unity-assets">Unity Assets</a> section; websites like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gameassetdeals.com/">this one</a> allow to track the significant discounts that are regularly made on assets</li>

<h3>Basics</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>OpenGL is a <strong>software interface to graphics hardware</strong>, i.e. an API of around 150 functions (version 1.1)</li>
<li>OpenGL concentrates on <strong>hardware-independent 2D/3D rendering</strong>; no commands for performing window-related tasks or obtaining user input are included; for example frame buffer configuration is done outside of OpenGL, in conjunction with the windowing system</li>
<li>OpenGL offers only <strong>low-level primitives</strong> organised through a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.glprogramming.com/blue/ch02.html#id57691">pipeline</a> in which vertices are assembled into primitives, then to fragments, and finally to pixels in the frame buffer; as such OpenGL is a building-block for higher-level engines (ex: like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)">Godot</a>)</li>
<li>OpenGL is a <strong>procedural</strong> (function-based, not object-oriented) <strong>state machine</strong> comprising a larger number of variables defined within a given OpenGL state (named <em>OpenGL context</em>; comprising vertex coordinates, textures, frame buffer, etc.); said otherwise, relatively to an OpenGL context (which is often implicit), all OpenGL state variables behave like global variables; when a parameter is set, it applies and lasts as long as it is not modified; the effect of an OpenGL command may vary depending on whether certain modes are enabled (i.e. whether some state variables are set)</li>
<li>so the <strong>currently processed element</strong> (ex: a vertex) <strong>inherits (implicitly) the current settings of the context</strong> (ex: color, normal, texture coordinate, etc.); this is the only reasonable mode of operation, knowing that a host of parameters apply when performing a rendering operation (specifying all these parameters would not be a realistic option); as a result, any specific parameter shall be set first (prior to triggering such an operation), and is to last afterwards (being &quot;implicitly inherited&quot;), until possibly being reassigned in some future</li>
<li>OpenGL respects a <strong>client/server execution model</strong>: an application (a specific client, running on a CPU) issues commands to a rendering server (on the same host or not - see GLX; generally the server can be seen as running on a local graphic card), that executes them <strong>sequentially and in-order</strong>; as such, most of the calls performed by user programs are <strong>asynchronous</strong>: through OpenGL they are triggered by the program and return almost immediately, whereas they have not been executed yet; they have just be queued; indeed OpenGL implementations are almost always pipelined, so the rendering must be thought as primarily taking place in a background process; additional facilities like <em>Display Lists</em> allow to pipeline operations (as opposed to the default <em>immediate mode</em>), which are accumulated for processing at a later time</li>
<li>state variables are mostly server-side, yet some of them are client-side; in both cases, they can be gathered in <em>attribute groups</em>, which can be pushed on, and popped from, their respective server or client attribute stacks</li>
<li>OpenGL manages two types of data, handled by mostly different paths of its rendering pipeline yet that are ultimately integrated in the framebuffer through fragment-yielding rasterization:<ul>
<li>geometric data (vertices, lines, and polygons)</li>
<li>pixel data (pixels, images, and bitmaps)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>vertices and normals are transformed by the <strong>modelview</strong> and <strong>projection</strong> matrices (that can be each set and transformed on a stack of their own), before being used to produce an image in the frame buffer; texture coordinates are transformed by the <strong>texture</strong> matrix</li>
<li>textures may reside in the main, general-purpose, client, <strong>CPU-side memory</strong> (large and slow to access for the rendering) and/or in any auxiliary, dedicated, server-side <strong>GPU memory</strong> (more constrained, hence prioritized thanks to <em>texture objects</em>; and high-performance, rendering-wise)</li>
<li>OpenGL can operate on three mutually exclusive <strong>modes</strong>:<ul>
<li><em>rendering</em>: the default, most common one, discussed here</li>
<li><em>selection</em>: determines, based on stacks of user-specified &quot;names&quot;, which primitives would be drawn into some region of a window</li>
<li><em>feedback</em>: allows to captures the primitives generated by the vertex processing step(s) in order to resubmit this data multiple times</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Mini OpenGL Glossary</h3>
<p>Terms that are more or less specific to OpenGL:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Accumulation buffer</tt>: a buffer that may be used for scene antialiasing; the scene is rendered several times, each time jittered less than one pixel, and the images are accumulated and then averaged</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Context</tt>: a rendering context corresponds to the OpenGL state and the connection between OpenGL and the system; in order to perform rendering, a suitable context must be current (i.e. bound, active for the OpenGL commands); it is possible to have multiple rendering contexts share buffer data and textures, which is specially useful when the application use multiple threads for updating data into the memory of the graphics card</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Display list</tt>: a group of OpenGL commands that has been stored for subsequent execution, so that it can be sent and processed more efficiently by the graphic card</li>
<li>(pixel) <tt class="docutils literal">fragment</tt>: two-dimensional description of elements (point, line segment, or polygon) produced by the rasterization step, before being stored as pixels in the frame buffer; also defined as: &quot;a point and its associated information&quot;</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Evaluator</tt>: the part of the pipeline to perform polynomial mapping (basis functions) and transform higher-level primitives (such as NURBS) into actual ones (vertices, normals, texture coordinates and colors)</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Frame buffer</tt>: the &quot;server-side&quot; pixel buffer, filled, after rasterization took place, by combinations (notably blending) of the selected fragments; it is actually made of a set of logical buffers of bitplanes: the color (itself comprising multiple buffers), depth (for hidden-surface removal), accumulation, and stencil buffers</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">GL</tt>: <em>Graphics Library</em> (also a shorthand for <em>OpenGL</em>)</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">GLU</tt>: <em>OpenGL Utility Library</em>, a standard part of every OpenGL implementation, providing auxiliary features (ex:image scaling, automatic mipmapping, setting up matrices for specific viewing orientations and projections, performing polygon tessellation, rendering surfaces, supporting quadrics routines that create spheres, cylinders, cones, etc.); see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.glprogramming.com/blue/ch02.html#id24847">this page</a> for more information</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">GLUT</tt>, <em>OpenGL Utility Toolkit</em>, a window system-independent toolkit hiding the complexities of differing window system APIs and more complicated three-dimensional objects such as a sphere, a torus, and a teapot; its main interest was when learning OpenGL, nowadays is less used</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">GLX</tt>: the X extension of the OpenGL interface, i.e. a solution to integrate OpenGL to X servers; see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.glprogramming.com/blue/ch02.html#id86751">this page</a> for more information</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Pixel</tt>: <em>Picture Element</em></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Primitive</tt>: points, lines, polygons, images, and bitmaps</li>
<li>(geometric) <tt class="docutils literal">Primitives</tt>: they are (exactly) points, lines, and polygons</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Rasterization</tt>: the process by which a primitive is converted to a two-dimensional image</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Scissor Test</tt>: an arbitrary screen-aligned rectangle outside of which fragments will be discarded.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Stencil Test</tt>: conditionally discards a fragment based on the outcome of a selected comparison between the value in the stencil buffer and a reference value</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Texel</tt>: <em>Texture Element</em></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Vertex Array</tt>: these in-memory client-side arrays may aggregate 6 types of data (vertex coordinates, RGBA colors, color indices, surface normals, texture coordinates, polygon edge flags), possibly interleaved; such arrays allow to reduce the number of calls to OpenGL functions, and also to share elements (ex: vertices pertaining to multiple faces should preferably be defined only once); in a non-networked setting, the GPU just dereferences the corresponding pointers</li>

<div class="section" id="in-2d">
<h3>In 2D</h3>
<p>A popular convention, for example detailed in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter02.html#name10">this section</a> of the Red book, is to consider that the ordinates increase when going from the <em>bottom of the viewport to its top</em>; then for example the on-screen lower-left corner of the OpenGL canvas is <tt class="docutils literal">(0,0)</tt>, and its upper-right corner is <tt class="docutils literal">(Width,Height)</tt>.</p>
<p>As for us, we prefer the <a class="reference external" href="https://myriad.esperide.org/#2d-referential">MyriadGUI 2D conventions</a>, in which ordinates increase when going from the <em>top of the viewport to its bottom</em>, as depicted in the following figure:</p>
<p><span class="raw-html"><center><img src="myriad-2D-referential.png" id="responsive-image-xsmall"></img></center></span>
</p>
<p>Such a setting can be obtained thanks to:</p>
<pre class="code erlang literal-block">

</pre>
<p>In this case, the viewport can be addressed like a <strong>usual (2D) framebuffer</strong> (like provided by any classical 2D backend such as SDL) obeying the coordinate system just described: if the width of the OpenGL canvas is 800 pixels and its height is 600 pixels, then its top-left on-screen corner is <tt class="docutils literal">(0,0)</tt> and its bottom-right one is <tt class="docutils literal">(799,599)</tt>, and any pixel-level operation can be directly performed there &quot;as usual&quot;. One may refer to <tt class="docutils literal">gui_opengl_2D_test.erl</tt> for a full example thereof, in which line-based letters are drawn to demonstrate these conventions.</p>
<p>Each time the OpenGL canvas is resized, this projection matrix will have to be updated, with the same procedure yet based on the new dimensions.</p>
<p>Another option - still with axes respecting the MyriadGUI 2D conventions - is to operate this time based on <strong>normalised, definition-independent coordinates</strong>, ranging in <tt class="docutils literal">[0.0, 1.0]</tt>, like in:</p>
<pre class="code erlang literal-block">
<span class="nn">gl</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nf">matrixMode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">?</span><span class="nv">GL_PROJECTION</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w">

</pre>
<p>Using &quot;stable&quot;, device-independent floats instead of integers directly accounting for pixels may be more convenient. For example a resizing of the viewport will then not require an update of the projection matrix. One may refer to <tt class="docutils literal">gui_opengl_minimal_test.erl</tt> for a full example thereof.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="in-3d">
<h3>In 3D</h3>
<p>We will rely here as well on the MyriadGUI conventions, <a class="reference external" href="https://myriad.esperide.org/#3d-referential">this time for 3D</a> (not taking specifically time here):</p>
<p><span class="raw-html"><center><img src="myriad-space-time-referential.png" id="responsive-image-tiny"></img></center></span>

<p>These are thus Z-up conventions (the Z axis being vertical and designating altitudes), like modelling software such as Blender.</p>

<div class="section" id="a-tree-of-referentials">
<h3>A Tree of Referentials</h3>
<p>A given scene (a model) is made of a set of elements (ex: the model of a street may comprise a car, two bikes, a few people) that will have to be rendered from a given viewpoint (ex: a window on the second floor of a given building) onto the (flat) user screen (with suitable clipping, perspective division and projection on the viewport). Let's start from the intended result and unwind the process.</p>
<p>The rendering objective requires to have ultimately one's scene transformed as a whole in eyes coordinates (to obtain coordinates along the 2D screen referential, along the X and Y axes - the Z one serving to sort out depth).</p>
<p>For that, a prerequisite is to have the target scene correctly composed, with all its elements defined in the same (scene-global) space, in their respective position and orientation (then only the viewpoint, i.e. the virtual camera, can take the scene as a whole into account to jump into eye coordinates).</p>
<p>As each individual type of model (ex: a bike model) is natively defined in an abstract, local referential of its own, each actual model instance (ex: the first bike, the second bike) has to be specifically placed in the referential of the overall scene. This placement is either directly defined in that target space (ex: bike A is at this absolute position and orientation in the scene global referential) or relatively to a series of parent referentials (ex: this character rides bike B - and thus is defined relatively to it, knowing that the bike is placed relatively to the car, and that the car itself is placed relatively to the scene).</p>
<p>So in the general case, referentials are nested (recursively defined relatively to their parent) and form a tree whose root corresponds to the referential of the overall scene.</p>
<p>A series of model transformations has thus to be operated:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(model local referential Rm) -&gt; (parent referential 1 Rp1) -&gt; (...) -&gt; (Rpn) -&gt; (scene referential Rs)
</pre>
<p>Once the <strong>model</strong> is expressed as a whole in the scene-global referential, the aforementioned next transformations have to be conducted : <strong>view</strong> and projection.</p>
<p>In practice, all these operations are thanks to the multiplication of 4x4 homogeneous matrices.</p>

<h3>Shadows</h3>
<p>Determining the shadow of an arbitrary object on an arbitrary plane (representing typically the ground - or other objects) from an arbitrary light source (possibly at infinity) corresponds to performing a specific <strong>projection</strong>. For that, a relevant 4x4 (based on homogeneous coordinates) matrix (singular, i.e. non-invertible matrix) can be defined.</p>
<p>This matrix can be multiplied with the top of the modelview matrix stack, before drawing the object of interest in the shadow color (a shade of black generally).</p>

<p>Benefiting from a proper 2D/3D hardware acceleration on GNU/Linux is unfortunately not always straightforward, and sometimes brittle.</p>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id47">Testing</a></h2>
<p>First, one may check whether such acceleration is already available by running, from the command-line, the <tt class="docutils literal">glxinfo</tt> executable (to be obtained on Arch Linux thanks to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mesa-utils</span></tt> package), and hope to see, among the many displayed lines, <tt class="docutils literal">direct rendering: Yes</tt>.</p>
<p>One may also run our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Hull/blob/master/display-opengl-information.sh">display-opengl-information.sh</a> script to report relevant information.</p>
<p>A final validation might be to run the <tt class="docutils literal">glxgears</tt> executable (still obtained through the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mesa-utils</span></tt> package), and to ensure that a window appears, showing three gears properly rotating.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id22">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id48">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
<p>If it is not the case (no direct rendering, or a GLX error being returned - typically involving any <tt class="docutils literal">X Error of failed request:&nbsp; BadValue</tt> for a <tt class="docutils literal">X_GLXCreateNewContext</tt>), one should investigate one's configuration (with <tt class="docutils literal">lspci | grep VGA</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">lsmod</tt>, etc.), update one's video driver on par with the current kernel, reboot, sacrifice a chicken, etc.</p>
<p>If using a NVidia graphic card, consider reading this <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA">Arch Linux wiki page</a> first.</p>
<p>In our case, installation could be done with <tt class="docutils literal">pacman <span class="pre">-Sy</span> nvidia <span class="pre">nvidia-utils</span></tt> but requested a reboot.</p>
<p>Despite package dependencies and a not-so-successful attempt of using DKMS in order to link kernel updates with graphic controller updates, too often a proper 3D support was lost, either from the boot or afterwards. Refer to our <a class="reference external" href="GNULinux.html#software-update">software update section</a> for hints in order to secure the durable use of proper drivers.</p>

<li><strong>IK</strong>: <em>Inverse Kinematics</em>, the <strong>computation of intermediary joint parameters</strong> so that the end of the kinematic chain is at a given position and orientation; typically, if one wants the hand of a character to grasp the top of a chair, IK is used in order to determine the parameters of the character's wrist, arm, elbow, etc. that may be retained so that the hand is ultimately correctly placed on the chair (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics">more information</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Material</strong>: controls the optical properties of an object, i.e. how a 3D object appears on the screen, that is: the color of each point of the object (generally thanks to multiple texture maps, like diffusion, normal, specular, glow, etc.) and how reflective or dull its surface appears; designates, with OpenGL, a set of coefficients that define <strong>how the lighting model interacts with the surface</strong>; in particular, ambient, diffuse, and specular coefficients for each color component (R,G,B) are defined and applied to a surface and effectively multiplied by the amount of light of each kind/color that strikes the surface; a final emmissivity coefficient is then added to each color component so that objects can also be light emitters</li>
<li><strong>NURBS</strong>: <em>Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline</em>, a mathematical model using <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline">basis splines</a> (B-splines) that is commonly used in computer graphics for representing <strong>curves and surfaces</strong>, whose shape is determined by control points (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline">more information</a>)</li>
<li><strong>PBR</strong>: <em>Physically-Based Rendering</em> designates approaches to render images in a way that <strong>models the flow of light in the real world</strong>, for example thanks to photogrammetry; many PBR pipelines aim to achieve photorealism; in practice they often rely on the <strong>micro-facet theory</strong>, with specific materials (generally based on texture maps) and shaders (is also called PBS, for <em>Physically-Based Shading</em>); PBR is slowly becoming the standard for all materials</li>
<li><strong>PSD</strong>: <em>Photoshop Document</em>, a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/psd/">proprietary format for graphics</a> with layers, masks, etc. used by Adobe Photoshop (a commercial counterpart to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://krita.org">Krita</a>, etc.) often used to store textures that may still be edited as templates by the user - provided they are using Photoshop as well; however, at least to some extent, <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.gimp.org/wiki/PSD_support">Gimp is able to edit PSD files</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.krita.org/en/general_concepts/file_formats/file_psd.html">Krita too</a></li>
<li><strong>Rigging</strong> (or <em>Skeletal Animation</em>) consists in <strong>controlling the deformation of a mesh</strong> (a.k.a. a <em>skin</em>, the surface of a body) of an articulated object (typically a character) <strong>based on a virtual inner armature</strong> (a hierarchical set of interconnected parts, called <em>bones</em>, and collectively forming the skeleton or <em>rig</em>) in order to animate that mesh (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation">more information</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Textures</strong>: bitmaps (images) used to <strong>skin 3D objects</strong>, by defining the color of each point on the surface of the object in terms of texture coordinates; besides such 2D textures, 1D, 3D and 4D ones exist</li>
<li><strong>Texture Atlas</strong>: a texture (an image) containing a <strong>set of separate, elementary graphic elements</strong>, meant to be extracted thanks to texture coordinates, akin to a sprite sheet; doing so is useful to reduce the overhead that would be induced by the management of many smaller textures (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas">more information</a>)</li>
